# PlinkOnboard

PlinkOnboard is a fork of [OnboardLite](https://github.com/hackucf/OnboardLite).

This is to be replaced by an Influx instance in the future, a more fleshed-out approach with increased scope.

## Getting Started (local)
```py
# Requires >= Python3.8
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 index.py
```

## Deploying

1. Deploy a box.
2. Make sure the AWS CLI is set up and that `~/.aws` is populated.
- Create a new AWS user with the policies `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` and `PowerUserAccess` (or preferrably, a policy that includes the actions `dynamodb:*` and `sso:account:access`)
- [Install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Run `aws configure sso` on the host machine. See [this article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html) for more details.
- Create a new DynamoDB table named "hackucf_members" (default) with partition key `id`
3. Make sure Stripe is configured to work with a webhook at `$URL/pay/webhook/validate` and the account is activated.
- Create the webhook at the desired domain. Include the events `checkout.session.*`.
- Create a product to represent dues payments in the dashboard. This should be $10 + $0.60 to account for Stripe fees.
4. Request a configuration file with all the neccesary secrets/configurations for AWS, Stripe, Discord, and others.
5. Install dependencies: `sudo apt install -y nginx certbot build-essential python3.8 python3.8-dev` (or later versions of python3). You may need to use [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) to install `pip3.8` as well.
6. Install Python dependencies: `python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Configure `nginx` (recommended) to proxy to port 80/443 + enable HTTPS. Set headers like `Content-Security-Policy`.
- If you use nginx, PLEASE use HTTPS (if you can; Cloudflare will probably disagree and want to use its own cert).
8. Drop the following `systemd` service, replacing values as appropiate:
```conf
[Unit]
Description=Uvicorn instance to serve OnboardLite
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/OnboardLite/
Environment="PATH=/home/ubuntu/OnboardLite/"
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/uvicorn index:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --workers 2

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
10. Drop the following nginx site config:
```conf
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name join.hackucf.org;

        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_protocol_addr; # To forward the original client's IP address
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; # to forward the  original protocol (HTTP or HTTPS)
        proxy_set_header Host $host; # to forward the original host requested by the client

        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;

        location ^~ / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        }
}
```
9. Start and enable the service using `systemctl`. Do the same for `nginx` if installed.
10. Put the service behind Cloudflare (optional).
11. Generate the Apple Wallet secrets and place them in `config/pki`. See [this tutorial](https://github.com/alexandercerutti/passkit-generator/wiki/Generating-Certificates) for details.
12. Profit!

## Editing Form Data

To edit questions on a form, edit the JSON files in the `forms/` folder. Each JSON is a separate page that acts as a discrete form, with each value correlated to a database entry. OnboardLite uses a file format based on a simplified [Sileo Native Depiction](https://developer.getsileo.app/native-depictions) and achieves the same goal: render a UI from a JSON schema. The schema is, honestly, poorly documented, but is rendered by `util/kennelish.py`. In short, each object in an array is a discrete element that is rendered.

Database entries must be defined in `models/user.py` before being called in a form. Data type valdiation is enforced by Pydantic.

## Sudo Mode

Administrators are classified as trusted Operations members and are *not* the same thing as Executives. These are people who can view roster logs, and should be FERPA-trained by UCF (either using the RSO training or the general TA training). The initial administrator has to be set via DynamoDB's user interface.

## Security Concerns

Please report security vulnerabilities to `execs@hackucf.org`.
